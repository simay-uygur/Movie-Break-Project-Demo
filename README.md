# Movie-Break-Project-Demo
# Implementation Stage

İlmay:
Week1: 
-I researched how to extract data from FireBase and extracted movie data from TMDB and uploaded it to Firebase. Then we managed to pull data from Firebase.
Week2:
-Based on the data I captured, I spent time on movieRecommendation and userRecommendation methods. I also spent time on the chat and addFriends function.

Simay: 
Week1: We fetched movie data from TMDB API and uploaded to Firebase Realtime Database. I tried to write displayImage, loadUserName, loadMovieName methods that takes data and displays on the fxml page. 
Week2: I wrote the search methods with İlmay and display methods myself. Adding user as friend methods are also written by me which is in the guicontroller class

Emiralp İlgen:
Week 1:
- In the first week, I designed the user interface of the authentication page to create a visual basis for the application.
Week 2:
- In the second week, I wrote the remaining user interfaces so that the methods implemented in the application can be seen, checked and debugged. 
- I helped the backhand part and displaying the images in the user interface.

Pınar: 
Week 1: We worked on the GUI design and the GUI methods with Emiralp. Even though we had to make changes afterwards, we finished most of it in the first week.
Week 2: We spent some time understanding the other classes and then started helping others. I usually worked on chat with Perhat.

Everybody came every time we meet for writing the code.

How to execute: You should run the Welcome class to start the application and the dependencies are firebase and javafx. All infos are in moduleinfo class. 
IMPORTANT: you should open the Movie-Break Project-Demo folder, otherwise the relative paths would not work. This was a common problem when we were writing the code.
